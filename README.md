# ECE425-Labs 1 - 7

## Experiment 1 - GPIO

A general overview of how to use the GPIO ports available on the TM41C123GH6PM microcontroller, interfacing with onboard LEDs and pushbuttons on the EduBase-V2 Trainer Board.

## Experiment 2 - Sound Generation

Explores the core functionality of the buzzer, learning about basic music theory, and using the onboard DMT-1206 magnetic buzzer to play musical notes.

## Experiment 3 - PWM

This lab serves to experiment with Pulse Width Modulation, most notably for a variety of applications such as motor speed control, generating audio signals, varying the brightness of LEDs, and operating a servo motor.

## Experiment 4 - Interrupt Stopwatch

Serves as an introduction to interrupt-based systems, making for a more efficient way of designing systems with various peripherals without requiring the CPU to constantly wait for input. The end goal is to create a fully functional stopwatch using a segment display with pause, reverse, and reset features.

## Experiment 5 - ADC

Created a sensor-based system where we can interface with the onboard temperature sensor, light sensor, and potentiometer to display the readings through the onboard LCD screen while using the on-chip ADC.

## Experiment 6 - Stepper Motor

Learnt how to interface a stepper motor with the TM4C123 microcontroller for continuous rotation.

## Experiment 7 - UART-ADC

Learnt how to interface with analog sensors, converting their output to digital data via ADC, and transmit these readings to a serial terminal using UART.

## Experiment 8 - Tic-Tac-Toe UART

Implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe game through UART communication settings, interrupts, and handling data reception from a serial terminal.
